**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

Business management is primarily about making decisions. Business
analytics is a tool used in managerial decision making, involving data
analysis methods that are useful to managers. Applied business analytics
is thus about applying data analytics to managerial decision making. We
will focus upon distinguishing between uncovering patterns in data and
identifying the underlying drivers; and help you ask the important data
science / mining questions. You will use data, data analytics concepts,
techniques, and state-of-the-art tools to make faster and better
business decisions. Data, statistical and quantitative analysis,
exploratory and predictive models, and the Python programming language
will be reviewed.

**COURSE PREREQUISITES/COREQUISITES:**

Students are expected/required to independently set-up and configure all
required software.

Students are expected/required to use syntax appropriately.

**REQUIRED TEXTBOOK(S):**

Please see the [[list of articles from Harvard Business Review
(HBR)]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a3m7gx0S1DDsdLuJMFiPHIYddqkXF0xfaU5DCRjXrVc/edit).

**RECOMMENDED LEARNING MATERIALS (NOT REQUIRED):**

Here are a few books that cover using Python for data science:

\"Python for Data Science Handbook\" by Jake VanderPlas: This book
provides a thorough introduction to using Python for data science,
including working with scientific libraries such as NumPy and pandas,
and using Jupyter notebooks.

\"Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python\" by Joel
Grus: This book covers the basics of data science and machine learning,
including working with data in Python using libraries such as NumPy and
pandas.

\"Doing Data Science: Straight Talk from the Frontline\" by Cathy
O\'Neil and Rachel Schutt: This book provides an overview of data
science, including using Python for data manipulation, visualization,
and machine learning.

\"Python Data Science Cookbook\" by Packt Publishing: This cookbook
provides a collection of recipes for using Python for data science,
including working with data, visualizing data, and applying machine
learning algorithms.

**COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES**

At or before the conclusion of the course, the student should be able
to:

-   recognize the key vocabulary employed by data science / mining

-   ask key questions of a data science / mining team, allowing you to
    > use their results for your business expertise - display knowledge
    > and skills in the application of data warehouse and data mining
    > technologies and methodologies in business

-   understand and communicate the value of analytics across a variety
    > of business functions

-   have the skills to understand and illustrate business challenges,
    > identify appropriate business data and apply data analytics to
    > address challenges and solve problems

-   demonstrate an understanding of big data and big data technologies
    > as it applies to business data - present the knowledge and ability
    > to apply the data analytics lifecycle in operational and strategic
    > capacities - identify and apply different analytical modeling
    > techniques in the development of analytics solutions, and
    > communicate those solutions effectively using data visualization
    > techniques.

INSTRUCTIONAL METHODOLOGIES:

We will be using a combination of classroom and online instructional
methodologies including but not limited to lectures (in person and
recorded), discussions (classroom and online), and practical
application.

ATTENDANCE POLICY:

Your attendance is expected and necessary to understand the materials
and subject matter. If you miss more than one (1) class session without
an Institute-approved excused absence, you may be officially withdrawn
from the course.

GRADING POLICY:

Your final grade will be determined by computing your scores (in
different components of the course) as follows: [Course Component
Weight]{.underline} [Individual or Group]{.underline}

Homework (4) 30% Individual

Exams (2) 30% Individual

Team Project 25% Group

Participation 5% Individual

Attendance 5% Individual

Incentives/rewards 5% Individual

Total 100%

**Grade Weight Numerical Definition Definition**

**A** 4.00 93-100 Distinction

**A-** 3.67 90-92 High Pass

**B+** 3.33 87-89 Pass

**B** 3.00 83-86 Pass

**B-** 2.67 80-82 Provisional

**C+** 2.33 77-79 Provisional

**C** 2.00 73-76 Provisional

**F** 0.00 0-72 No Pass

**P** 0.00 Pass (for credit)

**S** 0.00 Satisfactory (no credit)

**U** 0.00 Unsatisfactory (no credit)

**W** 0.00 Withdrew

**IC** 0.00 Incomplete

**NR** 0.00 Not Reported

Grades of \"P\" or \"F\" are awarded to courses with this grading scheme
and carry academic credit. \"P\" or \"F\" grades do not calculate into
the GPA.

Wentworth does not offer students the option to audit a course; if a
student is granted an exception to this policy the course cannot be
converted at any time to a credit-bearing course and will not satisfy a
degree requirement.

**ADD/DROP:**

Students should check the academic calendar to confirm the add/drop
deadline. Dropping and/or adding courses is done online. Courses dropped
in this period are removed from the student's record.

Non-attendance does not constitute dropping a course. If a student has
registered for a course and subsequently withdraws or receives a failing
grade in its prerequisite, **then the student must drop that course**.
In some cases, the student will be dropped from that course by the
Registrar. However, it is the student's responsibility to make sure that
he or she meets the course prerequisites and to drop a course if the
student has not successfully completed the prerequisite. The student
must see his or her academic advisor or academic department chair for
schedule revision and to discuss the impact of the failed or withdrawn
course on the student's degree status.

**MAKE-UP POLICY:**

Make-up work is only allowed in the event of an Institute-approved
excused absence.

**ACADEMIC SUPPORT:**

The Center for Academic Excellence facilitates Wentworth students'
academic success and helps them to achieve their full learning
potential. Students may choose to receive individual assistance through
one-on-one tutoring in many subjects, including math, science, writing,
and major classes. In addition, the Center for Academic Excellence
offers Facilitated Study Groups (FSGs), tutor-led study tables, academic
workshops, and learning-strategy consultations. The peer-tutoring
program is certified by the College Reading and Learning Association's
International Tutor Training Certification program. To make an
appointment or to review our drop-in offerings, please visit
www.wit.edu/cae. For additional assistance or support on subjects not
listed, please reach out via email at cae\@wit.edu.

**ACADEMIC HONESTY STATEMENT:**

Students at Wentworth are expected to be honest and forthright in their
academic endeavors. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to
cheating, prohibited collaboration, coercion, inventing false
information or citations, plagiarism, tampering with computers,
destroying other people\'s coursework or lab or studio property, theft
of course materials, posting coursework/course materials to websites, or
other academic misconduct. If you have any questions, contact your
professor prior to submitting an assignment for evaluation. See your
academic catalog for a full list of definitions and the WIT Academic
