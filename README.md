## COURSE DESCRIPTION:

>Business management is primarily about making decisions. Business
>analytics is a tool used in managerial decision making, involving data
>analysis methods that are useful to managers. Applied business analytics
>is thus about applying data analytics to managerial decision making. We
>will focus upon distinguishing between uncovering patterns in data and
>identifying the underlying drivers; and help you ask the important data
>science / mining questions. You will use data, data analytics concepts,
>techniques, and state-of-the-art tools to make faster and better
>business decisions. Data, statistical and quantitative analysis,
>exploratory and predictive models, and the Python programming language
>will be reviewed.

## COURSE PREREQUISITES/COREQUISITES:

>Students are expected/required to independently set-up and configure all
>required software.

## INSTRUCTIONAL METHODOLOGIES:

We will be using a combination of classroom and online instructional
methodologies including but not limited to lectures (in person and

Grades of "P" or "F" are awarded to courses with this grading scheme
and carry academic credit. "P" or "F" grades do not calculate into
the GPA.

Wentworth does not offer students the option to audit a course; if a
student is granted an exception to this policy the course cannot be
converted at any time to a credit-bearing course and will not satisfy a
degree requirement.

**ADD/DROP:**

Students should check the academic calendar to confirm the add/drop
deadline. Dropping and/or adding courses is done online. Courses dropped
in this period are removed from the student's record.

Non-attendance does not constitute dropping a course. If a student has
registered for a course and subsequently withdraws or receives a failing
grade in its prerequisite, **then the student must drop that course**.
In some cases, the student will be dropped from that course by the
Registrar. However, it is the student's responsibility to make sure that
he or she meets the course prerequisites and to drop a course if the
student has not successfully completed the prerequisite. The student
must see his or her academic advisor or academic department chair for
schedule revision and to discuss the impact of the failed or withdrawn
course on the student's degree status.

**MAKE-UP POLICY:**

Make-up work is only allowed in the event of an Institute-approved
excused absence.

**ACADEMIC SUPPORT:**

The Center for Academic Excellence facilitates Wentworth students'
academic success and helps them to achieve their full learning
potential. Students may choose to receive individual assistance through
one-on-one tutoring in many subjects, including math, science, writing,
and major classes. In addition, the Center for Academic Excellence
offers Facilitated Study Groups (FSGs), tutor-led study tables, academic
workshops, and learning-strategy consultations. The peer-tutoring
program is certified by the College Reading and Learning Association's
International Tutor Training Certification program. To make an
appointment or to review our drop-in offerings, please visit
[CAE](www.wit.edu/cae). For additional assistance or support on subjects not
listed, please reach out via email at [cae@wit.edu](mailto:cae@wit.edu).

**ACADEMIC HONESTY STATEMENT:**

Students at Wentworth are expected to be honest and forthright in their
academic endeavors. Academic dishonesty includes but is not limited to
cheating, prohibited collaboration, coercion, inventing false
information or citations, plagiarism, tampering with computers,
destroying other people's coursework or lab or studio property, theft
of course materials, posting coursework/course materials to websites, or
other academic misconduct. If you have any questions, contact your
professor prior to submitting an assignment for evaluation. See your
academic catalog for a full list of definitions and the WIT Academic
